# ADAPTED FOR SPES PROJECT

version 1.0b 30 sept 2024

---

# Introduction

> **Le Grand Jeu does not** have a moralistic message to deliver, does not impose any alignment to the players and does not provide clear victory rules.
>
> Like in real life!
>
> This scenario, with the modification of the rules that it implies, has been prepared for application in the SPES project - Sustainability Performances, Evidence and Scenarios (funded by European Union’s Horizon Europe Programme).   
>   
> The SPES project deals with the following main research question: 
>
> **How can  productivity, equity, environmental sustainability, participation &  empowerment, and human security be reconciled to drive the transition  towards Sustainable Human Development in Europe?**  
>   
> Within the general scope of the SPES project, its Work Package (WP) #8 aims to understand the drivers of public support for and opposition against transition trajectories towards more socially and environmentally sustainable societies. WP8 addresses the core questions:  
> •To what extent do problem perceptions, key transition goals, associated policies and current tools to monitor progress match the attitudes and expectations of citizens in different socio-economic positions?  
> • From a bottom-up perspective, how should governments balance efforts to address ecological objectives, including climate change, with other economic and social priorities?  
> These questions are examined from the perspective of individuals as well as through a close attention to the formation of the collective interests and preferred policy solutions by citizens, with a particular attention on the youth.
>
> For these reasons, task 8.3 of the SPES project aims to elicit and assess the collective dimension of citizens’ perceptions of the transition, also exposing the process of forming shared opinions. 
>
> Therefore, a SPES-tailored version of Le Grand Jeu is deemed very appropriate to uncover collective opinions and preferences about initiatives, policies and instruments that citizens think are most important in promoting and facilitating the sustainability transition. The group-based nature of LGJ will give insights into what kind of concrete policy solutions are likely to encounter the support of citizens if implemented, and the collective political support from groups that are at particular risk of social and economic marginalisation.

For the SPES application, the very general objective of the play is the following:

**Are we able to jointly design a society/community/city that creates and ensure social value within the planetary boundaries? How? What are the interdependencies among actors?**

In this way, the SPES-tailored version of Le Grand Jeu endorses the SPES framework, and particularly its attention to the five pillars of Sustainable Human Development. Moreover, it resonates with the well-known Doughnut Economics by Kate Haworth that defines a safe and just space for humanity to thrive in.

> ### **About the game**

Le Grand Jeu is the name of a game designed in May-July 2016 by an expert group in a 4 days workshop, held in Milan 10-14 July 2016. The group gathered by Federico included artists, engineers, design experts and activists. The idea was to design a situation where some narratives about the future of our society could be told, crafted and discussed in a positive way together by a group of people.

Some games were from the beginning tools to spread ideas and have people adopt them and use them while reflecting over those issues. Is tha case of many games. LGJ is though to mirror some new concepts that can be quite technical and difficult to explain otherwise: stock and flow value chains, blockchains, radical transparency, consensus, governance, entropy, finite resources, renewable energy and grids are just some examples.

This little book contains an introduction to the game and a scenario specifically designed for SPES to enjoy playing the future of humanity starting from a sustainability perspective.

The rest is to the master and to the players to find out by doing.

The authors would like to thank all the players that helped us refine these scenarios and will help in the future to shape reality of a better world.

# 1. Game Elements

## THE PLAYERS

That's you.

Pick a color choosing the plastiline you like best.

And then there is a Game Master. It can be one of you. The game master ensures that the game flows and plays the world with everything that is "on the table". The GM is not a player. He is knowledgeable and impartial. More about mastering comes in the Game Mastering (section 3). 
**Be Aware**: *the term GM is a homage to the tradition of role playing games as Dungeons and Dragons, it does not imply specific powers of a "master and servant attitude". A GM serves the game...*

## THE PHYSICAL WORLD

LGJ is a turn based game. Turns stand for time, and allow to know what comes before and what comes after.

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|                                                              | The Boards consist in two similar pieces of diamond shaped transparent plastic. |
|                                                              | In this scenario we use two of them. They are transparent so you can use them to cover maps you have drawn yourself or a real map or anything else. |
|                                                              | The Grid is the mesh of triangles drawn on the board.        |
| Bio region grid: where you travel long distances             | The moving from one piece to the next on the grid is the travel. Every triangle stands for a bioregion some of the players will traverse. |
| Local grid                                                   | another grid stands for one of the bio regions were local economies live and strive. To set your triangle on the grid mean**s that you are connected to civilisation**; off the grid that you stand alone. <br />Two triangles connected form a micro grid. |
| ![image-20211110173915299](book-images/image-20211110173915299.png) | **THE LAND**                                                 |
|                                                              | You find transparent triangles to be used to represent the land that you control in the game. |
|                                                              | **to decide how many units of lands they have the players throw in the beginning** |
|                                                              | **Players can play on the land and-or as travelers**         |
|                                                              | You can place **The Land** on **The Board,** so the terrain is “on” the grid or off The Board, if you put it outside you mean you have no services (electricity, sewerage, running water, etc.) and and you have to provide to all by yourself. <br />What you see here is an arrangement between the many possible, were the no-grid is represented as two adiacent triangles with no grid drawn.<br />The Player can put the land were they want taking in account that for all our scenarios the total amount of land is finite. Therefore the master says that there cannot be more than a total of more than N units of land off the grid |
| Suggestion                                                   | Draw a map, populate your grid of characteristics, and superimpose the transparent grid to it.<br />Another tactics for map making are possible. |
|                                                              |                                                              |

## THE FORTUNE

Fortune comes (and goes) in many ways.

We prefer to use D&D style dices because we find them fun to use…

|                                                              | The Wheel                                                    |

| ![image-20211110175505256](LGJ-SPES-Playbook.assets/image-20211110175505256.png) | allows your master to map distribution laws of events **or** directions  of winds. It is specified in the scenarios. To operate it keep it on the palm of your hand and tick the arrow... |
|                                                              | **The Dices**                                                |
| ![dices](LGJ-SPES-Playbook.assets/dices.jpeg)                | Dices are for deciding the outcome of an action, an event where all cases have the same chance to happen, or to measure its outcome. For example determining a yield connected to our turn activities. Is up to the master to tell you which dices to use and how many.PS: in the box you will find a set of D&D dices, because we like those... <br />**Dices** are nominated in the standard way: 1d10 means throw one time a 10 faced dice; 2d6 means "throw two six faced dices" and so on. |
|                                                              |                                                              |
|                                                              |                                                              |
|                                                              | **The Cards**                                                |
|                                                              | In this scenario we have thought of 2 sets of cards: one is source of events for the scenario, a second one is set of issues that comes from the "Grand Jeu" and are to be played as global events to which players have to adapt. You will find the cards in the respective tables. Best thing is to keep them as cards, one for each and put them on the table in the beginning. |

### LGJ Cards

The cards of the forces from the local chaotic events for the two different **continents**. The **drawing of the card is decided by the Master (probability throw), the effect with a round of discussion between the participants.**

|                                                              | The Elements                                                 |

Elements are to be organised on 3 levels: procurement, production, 2.0. <br />Elements can be combined in lines of production, individually or cooperatively or under any other form of agreement you can come up with. <br />The Elements are to be written upon with a whiteboard marker, you will find some in the box |
|                                                              | **The Shadow**                                               |
| ![shadow](/home/fredd/Nextcloud/2024-gsr-school/LGJ/LGJ-GSR_wip/GSR-Booklet_WIP/book-images/shadow.png) | Greys and Whites are the main currency of the game.<br />(you can render that with different dry beans, glass beads, game fishes or stones from the GO game...) They are translating wide concepts like:     <br />White: money, cryptocurrency, resources, knowledge, energy etc.;     <br />Grey: pollution, loss of biodiversity, bad karma, depletion of resources, entropy, CO2 etc.                A third metric is Reds: representing the social value of the society/community attributed by the players in each round. |
|                                                              | *Is good for the master to be aware that to avoid any color bias, you can always invert the beans.<br />They are beans anyway, their color is not exactly the way they might give scandal...* |
| Social Coin                                                  | In the SPES scenario we have introduced a token for social results |
|                                                              |                                                              |
|                                                              |                                                              |
| ![2.1.](/home/fredd/Nextcloud/2024-gsr-school/LGJ/LGJ-GSR_wip/GSR-Booklet_WIP/book-images/2.1..png) | This is how the procurement element becomes something: On the left in both grays and whites its cost; on the right the yield it can give when operates (in this case 2d6, meaning two 6 sided dices). The top values are the investment cost, both in grays and in whites |

## THE REST OF THE STUFF

You will see in the box: there are markers, this book, sticky notes to write all kind of deals between you, small extra things to play with… AND some colour plastiline that you should already have used...

Post it notes, maps, pencils and wires of various colors your fantasy is the limit... If you play as Game Master feel free to customize the kit to your taste and needs for each scenario you want to play or design.

# 2. TO PLAY A GAME

> Le Grand Jeu is a future-thinking game that allows to set a situation where different conditions are simulated and concepts emerge from doing, players are peers and all languages intermix
>
> …. and a story emerge

The very general objective of the play is: Are we able to jointly design a society/community/city that creates and ensure social value within the planetary boundaries? How? What are the interdependencies among actors?

- We ask the players as well to put on their land a piece of plastiline with their color, to recognize them, and then to mimic the thing they will build adding and moulding more details as the game progress.
- To set up the game now your GM refer to the instructions of the scenario you chose to play
- Once you have set up the table accordingly you can just start, because all the rules can be introduced wile playing the first round

## PREPARATION 

**A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE GAME...**

A short clip / presentation is shared with all players (to be watched before the game) to set common parameters on the main elements of the game (objective, definition of social value, definition of planetary boundaries, etc.). 

In addition, a short questionnaire is filled out before the game (some days before) to collect information from each player on interests, perceptions, attitudes, and the interpretation of social value. 

**START OF THE GAME**

- decide who is the master (can be done with a dice throw, the highest score becomes "the Master")
- set up the game board
- set up three bowls of beans of different color
- let every player throw 2d6 for white and 1d6  for the gray they have at game beginning
- for each player throw 1d4+1 for the land they already have

**RULES**

- INDIVIDUAL WIN: Wins who, at the end of the game, has more whites after they have been balanced with the grays (as a proxy of the environmental sustainability of the player)
- COLLECTIVE WIN: The society/community built over the game will be considered coherent with the SPES framework if it ensures a solid social foundation (min 10 reds) and does not overshoot planetary boundaries (max 50). This rule is not communicated to players at the beginning of the game, but only revealed at the end.
- If the table has more than 50 grays we all die, to make the Ecological ceiling principle operational. 
- If a player dies the global gray pot gets 20 grays and every player gets 5, to make the "Leave no one behind" principles operational.

**EACH ROUND**

At their turn the players: <u>Pay dues</u> if any, they can be according to the scenario taxes, energy, money or else but are always accounted with the white coin; decide between one of the following

- Invest/Build/Entrepreneurship action
- Find/Research/Invent
- Call an assembly to decide upon a law proposal

At the end of each round, all players discuss the social value jointly created and assign a value (from 0 to 3)

**CLOSURE OF THE GAME**

The game concludes after 5/6 rounds. (The game should last 2.5 hours on average even for first timer players).

A final wrap-up session takes place to comment on both the outcome  (winner, social value, environmental impact) and the game experience, through individual comments (e.g., 3 minutes each) and a collective discussion.

Then evaluate , and the story about how each table has achieved these results

**A FEW DAYS AFTER THE GAME...**  

A short questionnaire is filled out after the game on the experience and change of attitudes / interpretations of social value and planetary boundaries

## 2.2. How to be GM for a simple game

- You want people to have fun and everyone to speak
- You play the world both in the scenario (the small game) and outside (the big game), you use dices to take decisions, and have access to the larger store of beans
- You take care of the rounds and the accounts and to translate what the player decides to do in the language of the game
- You are the Master of Chaos, have fun
- You can use a 3-minute hourglass/sand timer to limit the time of discussion (in Assembly) or decisions, (if necessary). Other techniques are the stick of speach, throw the dice to decide the firs and co (conter) clockwise etc. Try to give space to everyone to play.

DECISIONS

- 10 faced dices are for percentages. Can be used to determine the success of an action.
  - es: player says "I am going to set up a workshop for electric bikes and solar energy"; Then throws 10 faced dices, and obtain a throw of 6, that on a scoresheet 1 to 10 is a reasonable success.
  - Master reasons: "This exists in our word, and you have empty space to build it, so you can do it. It will cost **X white** to establish, and account the generation of **Y greys** for the environmental cost of your decision. To operate it will need an investment of x and will produce 1d4 of yield and y greys of impacts on the environment".
  - Accordingly to the master judgement a success of 100% (or a failure with a throw of 1 or 2) can be prised or punished
- 20 faces dices are mostly used for inventions. Player says:" I want to invent a technology to have bike batteries that recharge 3 times faster". The master opens a short discussion with open questions like: "what would you think the advantage would be economically or environmentally". The master as well decides if the invention is to be allowed (for example contradicts a principle of Thermodynamics). Then considering everything gives a success level on the 20 faces dice, for example 3/20 means only 18,19,20 pass the round with a success.
  To research on something the player has to spend money and generates gray, so is to decide as well how much and if the grey effects the player's own account or the world one, as if is, as an example, CO2 in the atmosphere.
- d4, d6, d8, d12 maps usually the variability of yields, so use them wisely in measuring the yield of activity to map as well the risk. You can decide as well to model losses if you need but the less time you need to account for the economy of a turn the more time you leave to the game to develop.
- The use of the Weel is introduced later on in this guide, as a general rule you should play the weal to introduce chaos. Players can throw a round of Weal and pick a card. Is used as well if you need to decide about directions (for example of the wind) in a particular moment.
- At the end of each round, the master should guide the players in discussing the meaning of social value and whether they believe the collective deserves the Reds (up to 3). This will help capture the participants' interpretation of social value and observe if it evolves throughout the game through playing together and engaging in these discussions.

**OBSERVER/ STORYTELLER**

For the SPES game we point out the necessity of a team of two to play. The GM (that can be as well substitute by one of the participants) and a observer. The observer takes notes to be able to tell the story of the game and to realte it to the scopes of the players group. The storytelling function is very important, because we learn tools to build stories. She/He should also use post-it or coloured chalks to take notes on policies, approaches to solve problems, etc. (useful also for a matter of comparability across countries). The Observer is mandated to write the story of the game and to collect the points of view and perspectives of the players.

## P2.3. PLAY THE BASIC SCENARIO

The basic scenario we usually propose to learn to play the game is something along these lines:

> You and a group of friends have decided to go to live in a mid-sized city characterized by a dynamic core area, some rural adjacent restorable land and some off-the-grid "wilder" wilderness. You would like to live happy in a cohesive society and in harmony with nature. The place is populated by overall friendly people and has some basic grid facilities, but you can as well decide to put yourself off the grid. Basic infrastructure (e.g., internet, water, electricity) and basic social services are available on the grid for 3 white of local tax to be payed at each round.

We call it the "wellbeing city" scenario and usually brings out a lot of issues to ensure a safe and just space for human flourishing for all.

The game master has to keep track about the wellbeing of the "non playing participants" to the life of the city and treat the players a bit as newcomers...

Another suggestion is to give focus not only to economy but to the society. In this scenario a GM might give (or take) greys as well for actions that change the karma of players and of the city atmosphere and not only related to economical advantage and/or production of goods.

The wheal of fortune can be used at the end of each round to add chaos to the strategies. Try to divide it in 50% chance of getting a LGJ card, another 20% of getting a local event and the rest divided equally between "invent" and a choice between "elections" and "business as usual". Alternatively, after the 3rd round a LGJ event happens.

REMEMBER, THE GM HAS TO HAVE FUN AS WELL.
If you find yourself loosing the "fun element" try to make a short pause or give the mastering task to someone else,  throw dices to pick your future choices or even better take a LGJ card yourself...

# 3. GAME MASTERING TIPS

We list here some of the skills that people might want to explore-learn-simulate in the game. Many more can be invented, introduced, both in preparation of the game and during it.

- Use your imagination

- access collective knowledge, ask your players

- model processes, put them on the table so that the table tells you what to do

- throw the dice, if you don't know anything you can get to a yes-no and give yourself a 50/50 chance
- you are the master of chaos

You can prepare tables to distribute anything that is in the scenario that you wish to play with your players. The following is an example:

Here’s a table for a 1d20 roll that assesses **social values** and **crime** in the rural area, helping to determine if a character is welcome or not. The table includes a range of social conditions, from highly welcoming to hostile, reflecting community dynamics, crime levels, and social cohesion.

| **1d20 Throw** | **Social Values and Conditions** | **Crime Level** | **Community Reception** |
|----------------|----------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| **1**          | **Hostile Environment** – Strong distrust of outsiders. Community values secrecy and is deeply fragmented. | **Very High** – Organized crime is prevalent; violence and intimidation are common. | **Not Welcome** – Significant risk of confrontation; outsiders are viewed with suspicion. |
| **2-3**        | **Unwelcoming** – Community is insular, valuing tradition over change. Outsiders are met with skepticism. | **High** – Crime is rampant, with petty crime and occasional violent incidents. | **Not Welcome** – Hard to integrate; any attempts at engagement are met with hostility. |
| **4-5**        | **Guarded** – Some community members are friendly, but overall, there is a wariness of newcomers. | **Moderate** – Occasional petty theft or vandalism; serious crime can occur sporadically. | **Somewhat Unwelcome** – Efforts to integrate may yield limited success; cautious engagement recommended. |
| **6-7**        | **Cautiously Welcoming** – Mixed feelings towards outsiders; some acceptance, but significant reservations remain. | **Moderate** – Petty crimes are common, but violent crime is rare. | **Somewhat Welcome** – Possible to find allies; gaining trust may take time and effort. |
| **8-9**        | **Ambivalent** – Community is indifferent; some support for outsiders, but many prefer to keep to themselves. | **Low to Moderate** – Rare incidents of theft or property damage, but community policing exists. | **Welcome with Caution** – Integration possible, but engagement is necessary to build trust. |
| **10-11**      | **Neutral** – A balanced perspective towards newcomers; some see value in collaboration, while others resist change. | **Low** – Minimal crime; community-focused initiatives keep crime low. | **Somewhat Welcome** – Opportunity exists for positive relationships; shared interests can foster trust. |
| **12-13**      | **Friendly** – Many community members are open to engaging with newcomers, valuing cooperation and support. | **Very Low** – Crime is rare; a strong sense of community accountability exists. | **Welcome** – Potential for collaboration; community activities can foster integration. |
| **14-15**      | **Inclusive** – Community actively encourages participation and values diverse contributions. | **Very Low** – Crime is almost non-existent; community works together to resolve disputes. | **Very Welcome** – Strong community support; newcomers are seen as valuable assets. |
| **16-17**      | **Welcoming** – Enthusiastic acceptance of newcomers; a sense of shared purpose drives collective efforts. | **Minimal** – Any crime is dealt with quickly and effectively by the community. | **Highly Welcome** – Opportunities for collaboration and support abound; new ideas are embraced. |
| **18-19**      | **Supportive** – A vibrant, engaged community that thrives on diversity and welcomes contributions from all. | **Negligible** – Criminal activity is rare; community safety is a priority. | **Extremely Welcome** – Newcomers are seen as integral to community development and success. |
| **20**         | **Ideal Community** – A harmonious, diverse society with strong social values promoting sustainability and cooperation. | **Nonexistent** – No crime; community actively promotes well-being and social support. | **Unconditionally Welcome** – Newcomers are celebrated and actively encouraged to contribute to the community’s growth. |

### **Usage:**
- **Roll a 1d20** to assess the **social values**, **crime levels**, and **community reception** in the rural area.  
- The result can help determine the character’s **level of acceptance** within the community and provide context for interactions, challenges, and opportunities for collaboration.

This table enables players to navigate social dynamics in the rural area, influencing their strategies for integration and engagement while highlighting the impact of crime and social cohesion on their journey.



### Customizing Skills

You can create skill lists tailored to the setting or the specific characters. For example:

- **For Nia**: Permaculture, Water Management, Circular Economy.
- **For Yannis**: Animal Husbandry, Foraging, Traditional Craftsmanship.

Roll a D6 for each skill to determine proficiency:

- 1-2: Basic -2
- 3-4: Proficient -
- 5-6: Expert +1
