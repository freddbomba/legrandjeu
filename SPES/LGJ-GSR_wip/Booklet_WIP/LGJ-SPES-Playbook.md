# Introduction



> **Le Grand Jeu does not** have a moralistic message to deliver, does not impose any alignment to the players and does not provide clear victory rules.
>
> Like in real life!
>
> This scenario, with the modification of the rules that implies has been made to follow a case proposed by  the SPES project: 
>
> **How can  productivity, equity, environmental sustainability, participation &  empowerment, and human security be reconciled to drive the transition  towards Sustainable Human Development in Europe?**
>
>  
>
> SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCES, EVIDENCE & SCENARIOS
>
> A growing  consensus recognizes that economic growth does not inherently lead to  social inclusion and environmental sustainability. Economic, social, and environmental policies in Europe are progressively characterized by a  commitment to sustainable and inclusive growth, leaving no one behind.  But to achieve this, there is a need for original concepts and evidence  that can support European and global policies in the transition towards  achieving sustainable human development.

> ### **About the game**

Le Grand Jeu is the name of a game designed in May-July 2016 by an expert group in a 4 days workshop, held in Milan 10-14 July 2016. The group gathered by Federico included artists, engineers, design experts and activists. The idea was to design a situation where some narratives about the future of our society could be told, crafted and discussed in a positive way together by a group of people.

Some games were from the beginning tools to spread ideas and have people adopt them and use them while reflecting over those issues. Is tha case of many games. LGJ is though to mirror some new concepts that can be quite technical and difficult to explain otherwise: stock and flow value chains, blockchains, radical transparency, consensus, governance, entropy, finite resources, renewable energy and grids are just some examples.

This special edition of LeGrandJeu was **volunteer work** of Federico for GSR Summer school and is there to provide an engaging tool to talk about the complex implications of sustainable travel in an engaging way.

This little book contains an introduction to the game and a scenario specifically designed together with GSR team to enjoy playing the future of humanity starting from a sustainable travel perspective.

**GSR Scenarios** were co-designed by Federico Bonelli and a group of participants during a sprint, carried out Romania's GSR Summer School in July 2024. 

The rest is to the master and to the players to find out by doing.

The authors would like to thank all the players that helped us refine these scenarios and will help in the future to shape reality of a better world.



# 1. Game Elements

## THE PLAYERS

That's you. 

Pick a color choosing the plastiline you like best.

And then there is a Game Master. It can be one of you. The game master ensures that the game flows and plays the world with everything that is "on the table". The GM is not a player. He is knowledgeable and impartial. More about mastering comes in the Game Mastering (section 4). **Be Aware**: the term GM is a homage to the tradition of role playing games as Dungeons and Dragons, it does not imply specific powers of a "master and servent attitude". A GM serves the game...



## THE PHYSICAL WORLD

LGJ is a turn based game. Turns stand for time, and allow to know what comes before and what comes after.

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|                                                              | The Boards consists in two similar pieces of diamond shaped transparent plastic. |
|                                                              | In this scenario we use two of them. They are transparent so you can use them to cover maps you have drawn yourself or a real map or anything else. |
|                                                              | The Grid is the mesh of triangles drawn on the board         |
| bio region grid: were you travel long distances              | The moving from one piece to the next on the grid is the travel. Every triangle stands for a bioregion some of the players will traverse. |
| local grid                                                   | another grid stands for one of the bio regions were local economies live and strive. To set your triangle on the grid means that you are connected to civilisation; off the grid that you stand alone. Two triangles connected form a micro grid. |
| ![image-20211110173915299](book-images/image-20211110173915299.png) | **THE LAND**                                                 |
|                                                              | You find transparent triangles to be used to represent the land that you control in the game. |
|                                                              | **to decide how many units of lands they have the players throw in the beginning** 1d4+1 |
|                                                              | **Players can play on the land and-or as travelers**         |
|                                                              | You can place The Land on The Board, so the terrain is “on” the grid or off The Board, if you put it outside you mean you have no services (electricity, sewerage, running water, etc.) and and you have to provide to all by yourself. <br />What you see here is an arrangement between the many possible, were the no-grid is represented as two adiacent triangles with no grid drawn.<br />The Player can put the land were they want taking in account that for all our scenarios the total amount of land is finite. Therefore the master says that there cannot be more than a total of more than N units of land off the grid |
| Suggestion                                                   | Draw a map, populate your grid of characteristics, and superimpose the transparent grid to it. |
| Travelers                                                    | For the traveler we use a procurement house shaped piece from the kit. The idea is that the traveler brings knowledges and life seeds on to the grid... |

## THE FORTUNE

Fortune comes (and goes) in many ways. 

We prefer to use D&D style dices because we find them fun to use…



|      | The Wheel                                                    |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      | allows your master to map distribution laws of events **or** directions  of winds. It is specified in the scenarios.<br />![image-20211110175505256](LGJ-GSR-Playbook.assets/image-20211110175505256.png) To operate it keep it on the palm of your hand and tick the arrow... |
|      | **The Dices**                                                |
|      | ![dices](LGJ-GSR-Playbook.assets/dices.jpeg)Dices are for deciding the outcome of an action, an event where all cases have the same chance to happen, or to measure its outcome. For example determining a yield connected to our turn activities. Is up to the master to tell you which dices to use and how many.PS: in the box you will find a set of D&D dices, because we like those... <br />**Dices** are nominated in the standard way: 1d10 means throw one time a 10 faced dice; 2d6 means "throw two six faced dices" and so on. |
|      | **Special Dices**                                            |
|      | We have found a dice with directions while playing in Romania. We think it is a interesting addition to the game but yet we don't know how. 1d4 can always be used by the master when in doubt on a direction (1-north, 2-west, 3-south, 4-east). |
|      | **The Cards**                                                |
|      | In this scenario we have thought of 3 sets of cards: one is source of events for the scenario, another consists in stories that can be taken up by moving players, a third one is set of issues that comes from the "Grand Jeu" and are to be played as global events to which players have to adapt. You will find the cards in the respective tables. Best thing is to keep them as cards, one for each and put them on the table in the beginning. |

### LGJ Cards

The cards of the forces from the local chaotic events fro the two different continents. The drawing of the card is decided by the Master (probability throw), the effect with a round of discussion between the participants.

#### Stories Cards

We decided to collect some basic storylines from and for travelers, we should pop corn those, as a bunch of cards to take if you are dubious as a starter or as a way to involve in role playing newcomers. Popcorn here...

| ![shadow](/home/fredd/Nextcloud/2024-gsr-school/LGJ/LGJ-GSR_wip/GSR-Booklet_WIP/book-images/shadow.png) | Greys and Whites: the currency of the game <br />They are translating wide concepts like:     <br />White: money, cryptocurrency, resources, knowledge, energy etc.;     <br />Grey: pollution, loss of biodiversity, bad karma, depletion of resources, entropy, CO2 etc. |
|                                                              | Is good for the master to be aware that to avoid any color bias, you can always invert the colours.<br />They are beans anyway, their color is not exactly the way they might give scandal... |
|                                                              | PS all our existing currencies carries discrimination in many ways, would you feel like making a list? |
| ![](LGJ-GSR-Playbook.assets/reddot.jpg)                      | Red Dots mean knowledge you carry with you. Is something you master well enough to use and teach. Can be anything, from robotics to permaculture, to plant lore, on how to make colors from plants and minerals, tree pruning, tree housing, plumbing, car repair skills, dental surgery... |
|                                                              |                                                              |
| ![2.1.](/home/fredd/Nextcloud/2024-gsr-school/LGJ/LGJ-GSR_wip/GSR-Booklet_WIP/book-images/2.1..png) | This is how the procurement element becomes something: On the left in both grays and whites its cost; on the right the yield it can give when operates (in this case 2d6, meaning two 6 sided dices). The top values are the investment cost, both in grays and in whites |



## THE REST OF THE STUFF

You will see in the box: there are markers, this book, sticky notes to write all kind of deals between you, small extra things to play with… AND some colour plastiline that you should already have used...

Post it notes, maps, pencils and wires of various colors your fantasy is the limit... If you play as Game Master feel free to customize the kit to your taste and needs for each scenario you want to play or design.

# 2. TO PLAY A GAME

> Le Grand Jeu is a future-thinking game that allows to set a situation where different conditions are simulated and concepts emerge from doing, players are peers and all languages intermix 
>
> …. and a story emerge



- We ask the players as well to put on their land a piece of plastiline with their color, to recognize them, and then to mimic the thing they will build adding and moulding more details as the game progress.
- To set up the game now your GM refer to the instructions of the scenario you chose to play
- Once you have set up the table accordingly you can just start, because all the rules can be introduced wile playing the first round

## 2.1. PREPARATION OF A SIMPLE GAME

 

- decide who is the master (can be done with a dice throw, the highest score becomes "the Master")
- set up the game board

- set up two bowls of beans of different color

- let every player throw 2d6 for white and 1d6  for the gray they have at game beginning

- for each player throw 1d4 for the land they already have 

**RULES**

- Wins who, at the end of the game has more whites after they have been balanced with the grays
- If the table has more than 50 grays we all die
- If a player die the global gray pot gets 20 grays and every player gets 5

**EACH ROUND**

At their turn the players: <u>Pay dues</u> if any, they can be according to the scenario taxes, energy, money or else but are always accounted with the white coin; decide between one of the following

- Invest/Build/Entrepreneurship action
- Find/Research/Invent
- Call an assembly to decide upon a law proposal



## 2.2. How to be GM for a simple game



- You want people to have fun and everyone to speek
- You play the world both in the scenario (the small game) and outside (the big game), you use dices to take decisions, and have access to the larger store of beans
- You take care of the rounds and the accounts and to translate what the player decides to do in the language of the game

- You are the Master of Chaos, have fun



DECISIONS

- 10 faced dices are for percentages. Can be used to determine the success of an action. 
  - es: player says "I am going to set up a workshop for electric bikes and solar energy"; Then throws 10 faced dices, and obtain a throw of 6, that on a scoresheet 1 to 10 is a reasonable success.
  - Master reasons: "This exists in our word, and you have empty space to build it, so you can do it. It will cost **X white** to establish, and account the generation of **Y greys** for the environmental cost of your decision. To operate it will need an investment of x and will produce 1d4 of yield and y greys of impacts on the environment".
  - Accordingly to the master judgement a success of 100% (or a failure with a throw of 1 or 2) can be prised or punished
- 20 faces dices are mostly used for inventions. Player says:" I want to invent a technology to have bike batteries that recharge 3 times faster". The master opens a short discussion with open questions like: "what would you think the advantage would be economically or environmentally". The master as well decides if the invention is to be allowed (for example contradicts a principle of Thermodynamics). Then considering everything gives a success level on the 20 faces dice, for example 3/20 means only 18,19,20 pass the round with a success. 
  To research on something the player has to spend money and generates gray, so is to decide as well how much and if the grey effects the player's own account or the world one, as if is, as an example, CO2 in the atmosphere.
- d4, d6, d8, d12 maps usually the variability of yields, so use them wisely in measuring the yield of activity to map as well the risk. You can decide as well to model losses if you need but the less time you need to account for the economy of a turn the more time you leave to the game to develop.

- The use of the Weel is introduced later on in this guide, as a general rule you should play the weal to introduce chaos. Players can throw a round of Weal and pick a card. Is used as well if you need to decide about directions (for example of the wind) in a particular moment.

 

## 2.3. PLAY THE BASIC SCENARIO

The basic scenario we usually propose to learn to play the game is something along these lines:

> You and a group of friends have decided to go to live in a beautiful village in the middle of the mountains. You would like to live happy and in harmony with nature. The place is populated by overall friendly people and has some basic grid facilities, but you can as well decide to put yourself off the grid. Internet, water, electricity is available on the grid for 2 white of local tax to be payed at each round. 

We call it the "happy valley" scenario and usually brings out a lot of surprises. 

The game master has to keep track about the happiness of the "non playing participants" to the life of the valley and treat the players a bit as newcomers... 

Another suggestion is to give focus not only to economy but to society. In this scenario a GM might give (or take) greys as well for actions that change the karma of players and of the valley atmosphere and not only related to economical advantage and/or production of goods.

The weal of fortune can be used at the end of each round to add chaos to the strategies. Try to divide it in 20% chance of getting a LGJ card, another 30% of getting a local event and the rest divided equally between "invent" and a choice between "elections" and "business as usual".

REMEMBER, THE GM HAS TO HAVE FUN AS WELL. 
If you find yourself loosing the "fun element" try to make a short pause or give the mastering task to someone else,  throw dices to pick your future choices or even better take a LGJ card yourself...
