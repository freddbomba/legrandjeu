## Fork 2 - HackLife

Author: Federico Bonelli

This major adaptation (or fork) of Le Grand Jeu (LGJ) is intended to model life both online and offline, its economy, its consistency rules. Bitcoins, Hack, Cybercrime, Privacy, Espionage, Profiling and Big Data Warehouses are considered, modeled and exposed wile playing the game, together with fluid democracy, alt currency and transition ideas. To do so some more elements have been added. Major changes occur if compared to the LGJ standard rule set (LGJRS) as it has stabilised in interaction 7.

The original game, LGJ, as a table game, allows to set a situation where concepts emerge from doing, players are by default considered as peers and ideas emerge from the context of the game that can be precious in incept modelling and design requirements. We can simulate different conditions and lead to experiment with different behaviours as well as strategies and inner goals of the players not only manifest but interact. The game can be used for fun, for situation analysis, modeling, co-design and as a storytelling environment. It is envisioned that in certain forms the game can become a framework as well for a performative act.

Players  get immediate feedback about what they know and they do from the game environment itself. During the game languages intermix, specialist terminology has to be translate, and stories emerge. Stories together contribute to draw a narrative, a set of dynamics waypoint or guides for thought that are a very powerfull, and necessary, design tool.

This spinoff refers to the rules and motivations of LGJ, so refer to main readme.md in github. Is also expected to have a little experience in LGJ to be able to master a game for new players. So please contact us at dyne.org to get aquainted with the game and its value.

The Hack Life variant of the game (HLJ) comes with a set of components designed to be produced by players themselve, either with pen and paper or with the help of a printer or a laser cutter:
- ID:
- Triangular shapes that fit every area on the network are named "Identities".
 If you put your area outside of the network you say that that identity is off the grid or isolated. Adjacent territories can transport matter without extra expenses. They Stand for "one Identity". Some, more complex in shape are the result of the coupling of the ID and a "body". They are given one for player at the beginning.

- The Board:
The playing surface consists of a diamond shaped grid of triangular boxes. This grid stands for "the Network" when is seen as dots connecting points and as "the meatspace" as it is seen as only the area.
The board of HackLife is divided in 2 parts: the LIGHT and the DARK. As the Network could be divided as "The Open Internet" (Right) and "The Darknet" (Left).  Outside the grid a ID can still be placed, being therefore isolated, or off the grid. It can be used to represent a particular state of a player's ID.



- Currency: Blacks, Red and Whites are the tree the currency of the game translating wide concepts like:
  - white: legit money, cryptocurrency, Resources, Energy, etc.
  - black: Pollution, bad karma, corrupted data and necessary loss of information etc.
  - red: credibility, skill, knowledge etc

- Reputation: Every Identity has a Reputation (scale zero to N)
  - Reputation is necessary for setting up a production line and every production line has a reputation trashold below wich it becomes impossible or gets revoked
  - Example: below reputation 5 can be impossible to have a credit card
  - Reputation can also lead to bonuses or malus on operations (is actually in roleplaying terms a "modifier")
  - Knowledge is a modifier for "inventions" and a payment in red coins can also be added to it, to buy more or less chance.


Every Action is measured by a mix of white black and red currencies that reflect in the portfolio of a player or of her Identity.

Accounting into currency transactions allows to correctly model information based economy.

- Dices: A set of dices: to rule probability, in particular chance events; the game master can decide to introduce for the fun of it more n-sided dices, but basically most things can be modeled with d6.
Notation: 1d6 means "throw one dice of 6", 2d8 "throw two dice of 8" etc.

- The Wheel of Fortune: Is a tool to simulate events that have, a priori, a distribution type of probability. Includes various types of events, invent, that pertain to knowledge and research, enjoy that is a social call, destroy with its socio-political implications. For particular purposes the distributions can be varied at the beginning of the game by the master, therefore the wheel is blank and you can write upon.
in HLJ Ruleset these tipically are:
  - Pick up an Unexpected Event Card
  - Pick up a LegrandJeu Says card
  - Learn a new skill
  - You Get-Busted!
  - Project

- Alignements
There are 2 major alignements, one for the open society and one for the dark one. Each one of the alignements can be chosen from 3 options
OPEN: Legal, Chaotic, Anarchistic
DARK: Good, Neutral, Evil

Some examples: A corporate executive can be Legal, because his acts are designed to comply with the rules of the Law in the place he has citizenship, and Neutral or Chaotic in the Darknet, were he does not care about the impact on the third parties of his actions and thinks only about his personal gain.
A Hacker can be openly Anarchistic regarding to the Law, so has an alignement of "Neutral" and Good regarding to a ethical code of conduct online.

- the Open economy is visible to all players. Is the plate were both black and white coins stay after they are "generated" by players activity. On this plate can operate the assembly, redistributing resources or deciding taxation schemes.

- The Functional Elements and the Line:
 and on 3 levels: procurement, production, 2.0. To each element is associated a production cost, a management cost and a yield. Element can be combined in lines of production, individually or cooperatively or under any other form of agreement. The master can extend this side in his presentation of the game whenever the game is organized to set a situation.

- Lands and Tokens: free representation and production of the Lands owned by players and of the Functional Elements acquired or exchanged to be placed on the Board. The gamers are also provided with building material  (pongo or sticks and colored papers), and encouraged to build upon their territories what they have constructed as a line of processes.

- Means of transport, logistics etc.
They can be simulated in the game and described as production lines or as physical movement on the board. If that is relevant to the economy of the game, physical representation will be made by the player to be put on the board and moved.

- Master diary: to inspire and support the reporting of the Master including a Note-taking form, a matrix of Elements, a list of Events and a list of Victory rule for the table and for the tournament. Is worked out before the game to set some general scenario.


A set of basic rules:

Set-up: roll of dice to distribute lands, blacks and whites to the players. Is up to the master to decide how much land and resources our players have access to at the beginnig of the game. Es. 1d6 of Territories, 3d6 of white, 1d6 of black each. Red is dealt with differently.

Round:

Set-up
- Body-ID is set
- Assignment of initial coins using dices
- Assignment of initial REPUTATION level
- Player Choses his Alignment, name and
- Assignment of 2 IDs to each player, the ID can be placed on the board

TURN
- each player pays a fixed rate of white (living allowances) in the Common pot; this is the "expenses/taxes";
- collects the result of his activities
- then decides between “Invests” or “Learn”, “Call the Assembly”.
- At the end of every round the master spins the wheel

## How to win
According to the rule adopted to win we will develop the game in a direction or another. The rule is stated at the beginning according to the situation that we want to model in the game by the Master. For example the more used are:
a) wins the player that after n tours (or for ex. 2 hrs game time) has the best balance between white and Blacks
another can be
b) wins who has more white, no matter the Blacks

in case of multiple tables wins the table that has less black

## Strategies:
- Try to create a cooperative production line  
- Experiment with circular economy,
- Allow (although realistically) crime,
- Include disruption, destruction and world lore in the game

## The Game master
The Game is facilitated by a Master that plays the wheel of Fortune, rules the creation of new Elements and laws, and report the strategies and dynamics arisen on the Diary. The Master should have a basic knowledge of physics, economy and enough creativity to nurture a plausible and fun game playing neutrally.

some key concepts for the master to help to assest his role:

> I am the chaos master
> 0. I keep notes
> 1. I shift information
> 2. I carve the situation and move it to the flow
> 3. I act upon space/time with perception altering technique
> 5. I give and take out weight to elements
> 6. I act with true intentions
> 7. i take the blame and responsibility
> 8. I can be you
> 9. To decide i throw dices
> 10. If i have no idea probability can be 50%

### Master typically allowed behaviours

The Master plays "the world" and allows the overall flow of the game. Being after all a open-ruleset game with a role playing component, LGJ allows many styles of mastering. Remember as always that the scope of any game is to have fun. To have fun can be contajous, so also the master is supposed to have a bit of sense of humor and a dose of patience.

- for player’s death double the black for all players
- the commandment to "Have Fun" is a great occasion to alleviate tension, but also a way to show that to invest in community free and accessible leisure is as important as other factors.

## notes

Taken from my methodological notes, stand here to summarise concepts that have a long explaination elsewere.

### The Situation

0. The situation is the game field
1. Situations can not be meaningful if isolated
2. Morphic field hypothesis: connections between agents in situation and different situations is mobile and full of tunnels.
3. A situation is always in a place. The place is therefore an actor in the process
4. A situation has a duration
5. A situation has actors. No pure observer exist; a situation that is spied upon is a different situation from one that is not spied upon, no matter if those in the situation know or not about their observers.
6. A useful situation is temporary
7. A situation is useful to our aims when there is a third force that determines its end: for example a performance or a final presentation or a review

### The Transformation
Transformation is the element that describes the welcomed rise of complexity in a creative process
1. In transformation self organisation is a good thing
2. Transformation is possible only in very strictly ruled systems within open situations
3. A re-organisation, ghestalt re-orientation or simplification maneuver that breaks symmetry of the problem is also a very good thing
4. Quality is not Perfection
5. Self similarity
6. Feedback
7. Tell stories
8. Lie: a good story is worth a change of perspective
9. A transformator is the working implementation of a transformation into a situation that is at the same time representing itself. This is media art implemented.
10. Minimalism is baroque of the lazy people
