#¨le Grand Jeu¨
## Fork 2 - HackLife

Author: Federico Bonelli

This adaptation of Le Grand Jeu (LGJ) is intended to model life online, its economy, its consistency rules. Bitcoins, Hack, Cybercrime, Privacy, Espionage, Profiling and Big Data Warehouses are considered and exposed wile playing the game.

LGJ is a table game allows to set a situation where concepts emerge from doing, players are by default considered as peers. We can simulate different conditions and let behaviour emerge as well as strategies and inner goals of the players.

Players  get immediate feedback about what they know and they do from the game environment. During the game languages intermix, specialist terminology has to be translate, and stories emerge.

This spinoff refers to the rules and motivations of LGJ, so refer to main readme.md in git

The Game comes with a set of DIY components:
- The Board: The playing surface consists of a diamond shaped grid of triangular boxes. The board of HackLife is divided in 2 parts: the LEFT and the RIGHT. The Network is divided as such as "The Open Internet" (R) and "The Darknet" (L). The all grid is referred as "the Network"

- Triangular shapes that fit every area on the network are named "Identities".
 If you put your area outside of the network you say that that identity is off the grid. Adjacent territories can transport matter without extra expenses.

- Currency: Blacks, Red and Whites are the tree the currency of the game translating wide concepts like:
  - white: legit money, cryptocurrency, resources, knowledge, etc.
  - black: black money, pollution, bad karma, corrupted data etc.
  - red: fame, reputation, credibility, skill etc.

Energy and knowledge are measured by white currency; disinformation, fake news, etc in black.

Accounting into currency transactions allows to correctly model information based economy.

- Dices: A set of dices: to rule probability, in particular chance events; the game master can decide to introduce for the fun of it more n-sided dices, but basically most things can be modeled with d6.
Notation: 1d6 means "throw one dice of 6", 2d8 "throw two dice of 8" etc.

- The Wheel of Fortune: simulates an event that has, a priori, a clear distribution law of probability. Includes two types of events, the action of invent, enjoy and destroy. For particular purposes the distributions can be varied at the beginning of the game by the master, therefore the wheel is blank and you can write upon.

- Alignements
There are 2 major alignements, one for the open society and one for the dark one. Each one of the alignements can be chosen from 3 options
OPEN: Legal, Neutral, Evil
DARK: Good, Neutral, Chaotic

Some examples: A corporate executive can be Legal, because his acts are designed to comply with the rules of the Law in the place he has citizenship, and Neutral or Chaotic in the Darknet, were he does not care about the impact on the third parties of his actions and thinks only about his personal gain.
A Hacker can be openly Anarchistic regarding to the Law, so has an alignement of "Neutral" and Good regarding to a ethical code of conduct online.

- the Open economy is visible to all players. Is the plate were both black and white coins stay after they are "generated" by players activity. On this plate can operate the assembly, redistributing resources or deciding taxation schemes.

- The Functional Elements and the Line:
 and on 3 levels: procurement, production, 2.0. To each element is associated a production cost, a management cost and a yield. Element can be combined in lines of production, individually or cooperatively or under any other form of agreement. The master can extend this side in his presentation of the game whenever the game is organized to set a situation.

- Lands and Tokens: free representation and production of the Lands owned by players and of the Functional Elements acquired or exchanged to be placed on the Board. The gamers are also provided with building material  (pongo or sticks and colored papers), and encouraged to build upon their territories what they have constructed as a line of process

- Means of transport, logistics etc.
They can be simulated in the game and descrived as production lines. A physical representation will be made by the player to be put on the board and move.

- Master diary: to inspire and support the reporting of the Master including a Note-taking form, a matrix of Elements, a list of Events and a list of Victory rule for the table and for the tournament.


and a set of basic rules:

Set-up: roll of dice to distribute lands, blacks and whites to the players. Is up to the master to decide how much land and resources our players have access to at the beginnig of the game. Es. 1d6 of Territories, 3d6 of white, 1d6 of black each.

Round: each player pays 1 white in the Common pot; this is the "expenses/taxes";
then “Invests” or “Learns” or “Calls the Assembly”;
at the end he spins the Wheel of Fortune

Strategy: fee to create a cooperative production line 5 whites each Element;  fee for player’s death double the black for all players.


According to the rule adopted to win we will develop the game in a direction or another. The rule is stated at the beginning according to the situation that we want to model. For example the more used is
a) wins the player that after n tours (or for ex. 2 hrs game time) has the best balance between white and Blacks
another can be
b) wins who has more white, no matter the Blacks

in case of multiple tables wins the table that has less black

----

The Game is facilitated by a Master that plays the wheel of Fortune, rules the creation of new Elements and laws, and report the strategies and dynamics arisen on the Diary. The Master should have a basic knowledge of physics, economy and enough creativity to nurture a plausible and fun game playing neutrally.

some key concepts for the master:

> I am the chaos master
> 0. I keep notes
> 1. I shift information
> 2. I carve the situation and move it to the flow
> 3. I act upon space/time with perception altering technique
> 5. I give and take out weight to elements
> 6. I act with true intentions
> 7. i take the blame and responsibility
> 8. I can be you
> 9. To decide i throw dices
> 10. If i have no idea probability can be 50%

Some notes about the Situation
0. The situation is the game field
1. Situations can not be meaningful if isolated
2. Morphic field hypothesis: connections between agents in situation and different situations is mobile and full of tunnels.
3. A situation is always in a place. The place is therefore an actor in the process
4. A situation has a duration
5. A situation has actors. No pure observer exist; a situation that is spied upon is a different situation from one that is not spied upon, no matter if those in the situation know or not about their observers.
6. A useful situation is temporary
7. A situation is useful to our aims when there is a third force that determines its end: for example a performance or a final presentation or a review

2.3 The Transformation
Transformation is the element that describes the welcomed rise of complexity in a creative process
1. In transformation self organisation is a good thing
2. Transformation is possible only in very strictly ruled systems with open situations
3. A reorganisation, ghestalt re-orientation or simplification maneuver that breaks symmetry of the problem is a very good thing
4. Quality is not Perfection
5. Self similarity
6. Feedback
7. Storicize
8. Lie: a good story is worth a change of perspective
9. A transformator is the working implementation of a transformation into a situation that is at the same time representing itself. This is media art implemented.
10. Minimalism is baroque of the lazy people
