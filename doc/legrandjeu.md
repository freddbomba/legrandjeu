#¨le Grand Jeu¨
## A working example of situation oriented analysis for sustainable micro-economies,
## through game and methodologies taken from the arts



Le Grand Jeu
¨Le Grand Jeu"is the working name of a game designed in May-July 2016 by an expert group that includes the author of this paper, and that finalised in a 4 days workshop held in Milan 10-14 July 2016. The group includes artists, engineers, design experts and activists. The idea and the direction of the process came by to help design a situation where some narratives about the future of our society could be told, crafted and eventually discussed in a positive way. In a second step the game has been refined by Raffaella Rovida and Federico Bonelli in 2 subsequent iterations and used in Venice during Venice Biennale (Event Darkmatters Games May 2017).

A table game allows to set a situation where concepts emerge from doing, players are by default considered as peers. We can simulate different conditions and let behaviour emerge as strategies and goals. There intentions and informations from the players  get immediate feedback from the game environment. In a game all languages intermix, specialist terminology has to be translated, and stories emerge.

An interesting historical precedent to this approach is included in the genesis of the world famous counterpart of Le Grand Jeu, MONOPOLY.
Monopoly, that teaches traditional forms of capitalism to children since the ´30es had been originally developed to demonstrate the feasibility of socialist and progressive doctrines of Toureau. Developed and patented by a woman, Elisabeth Phillips, in 1903, it was plagiarized and sent to Parker Brothers that exploited it. It is apparently the man that plagiarized it who substituted "mother nature" with "the bank".

In the last 6 years Europe has been subject to an unprecedented and mostly bottom up strive for change. This request encompasses many areas of human and natural endeavour that were kept traditionally distinct. Innovation, Design,  Citizen initiatives, New political parties, Economy and culture, along the entire spectrum, from popular lore to academic trends, all have been shaken by the widespread strive to invent a different form of society. A shared need that has been recognised and requested loud and clear by the forces unleashed by the unsustainability of current economical model, the strength of the financial crisis, the capillarity and fragility of information technology and the availability of information itself.
In the avalanche of new languages, technical instruments, data, philosophical or political jargon the paradigmatic shift has still no clear shape. As such the debate polarised, excluding large part of the population and giving rise to a widespread feeling of frustration.
We felt a general lack of shared narratives, to be shared between specialists and common players, that could strive to build a different and positive image of this change. Traditionally this bridge, this playfield of simulated realities has been the territory of arts, particularly of performing ones. Transforming, inventing and collecting stories to tell, and testing those against the sensibility of any type of possible ¨audience¨.

We felt that this task was the cultural task of our generation and to this we wanted to contribute. As fellow researchers we agreed that this narrative to be build piece by piece with unity of intent, is a general tool to re-design reality.

Different challenges allow different methodologies. We have seen the rise and the many crisis of the free software movement from the inside, the widespread adoption of transversal methodologies in business and software design, like Agile Methodology for example, the rise and fall of cybernetics and the use of copyright to enforce the power of corporate conglomerates on the economy of knowledge. We have no naive illusion of the hero that saves the world. There is no world to be saved but a new attitude that is emerging by its complexity out of a general crisis of a dying paradigm. We wanted to set foot in the realm of the new one.

Our methodology and  transversal approach passes through three key points:
A - Inclusive and horizontal language
B - Learn by doing
C - Parallelisation of processes and cross fertilization within situation based transformation method



The Game comes with a set of DIY components:
- The Board: The playing surface consists of a diamond shaped grid of triangular boxes, which we will call the network.
- Triangular shapes that fit every area on the network are named "Territories".
 If you put your area outside of the network you say that that territory is off the grid. Adjacent territories can transport matter without extra expenses.

- Currency: Blacks and Whites are the two currencies of the game translating wide concepts like white: money, cryptocurrency, resources, knowledge, etc.; black: pollution, loss of biodiversity, bad karma, depletion of resources, raise of entropy, etc. Energy accounting into money transactions allows to correctly model circular economy subjects.

- Dices: A 6-sided die: to rule probability, in particular chance events; the game master can decide to introduce for the fun of it more n-sided dices, but basically most things can be modeled with d6.
Notation: 1d6 means "throw one dice of 6", 2d8 "throw two dice of 8" etc.

- The Wheel of Fortune: simulates an event that has, a priori, a clear distribution law of probability. Includes two types of events, the action of invent, enjoy and destroy. For particular purposes the distributions can be varied at the beginning of the game by the master

- the local economy is visible to everyone. It is the plate where both black and white coins stay after they are "generated" by players' activity. On this plate can operate the assembly, redistributing resources or deciding taxation schemes.

- The Functional Elements and the Line: Elements of Line of process organized for now in 4 lines: agriculture, animals, energy and logistics; and on 3 levels: procurement, production, 2.0. To each element is associated a production cost, a management cost and a yield. Element can be combined in lines of production, individually or cooperatively or under any other form of agreement. The master can extend this side in his presentation of the game whenever the game is organized to set a situation.

- Lands and Tokens: free representation and production of the Lands owned by players and of the Functional Elements acquired or exchanged to be placed on the Board. The gamers are also provided with building material  (pongo or sticks and colored papers), and encouraged to build upon their territories what they have constructed as a line of process

- Means of transport, logistics etc.
They can be simulated in the game and descrived as production lines. A physical representation will be made by the player to be put on the board and move.

- Master diary: to inspire and support the reporting of the Master including a Note-taking form, a matrix of Elements, a list of Events and a list of Victory rule for the table and for the tournament.


and a set of basic rules:

Set-up: roll of dice to distribute lands, blacks and whites to the players. It is up to the master to decide how much land and resources our players have access to at the beginnig of the game. Es. 1d6 of Territories, 3d6 of white, 1d6 of black each.

Round: each player pays 1 white in the Common pot; this is the "expenses/taxes";
then “Invests” or “Learns” or “Calls the Assembly”;
at the end he spins the Wheel of Fortune.

Strategy: fee to create a cooperative production line 5 whites each Element;  fee for player’s death double the black for all players.


According to the rule adopted to win we will develop the game in a direction or another. The rule is stated at the beginning according to the situation that we want to model. For example the more used is
a) wins the player that after n tours (or for ex. 2 hrs game time) has the best balance between Whites and Blacks
another can be
b) wins who has more Whites, no matter the Blacks

in case of multiple tables wins the table that has less Blacks.

----

The Game is facilitated by a Master that plays the wheel of Fortune, rules the creation of new Elements and laws, and report the strategies and dynamics arisen on the Diary. The Master should have a basic knowledge of physics, economy and enough creativity to nurture a plausible and fun game playing neutrally.

some key concepts for the master:

> I am the chaos master
> 0. I keep notes
> 1. I shift information
> 2. I carve the situation and move it to the flow
> 3. I act upon space/time with perception altering technique
> 5. I give and take out weight to elements
> 6. I act with true intentions
> 7. i take the blame and responsibility
> 8. I can be you
> 9. To decide i throw dices
> 10. If i have no idea probability can be 50%

Some notes about the Situation

0. The situation is the game field
1. Situations can not be meaningful if isolated
2. Morphic field hypothesis: connections between agents in situation and different situations is mobile and full of tunnels.
3. A situation is always in a place. The place is therefore an actor in the process
4. A situation has a duration
5. A situation has actors. No pure observer exist; a situation that is spied upon is a different situation from one that is not spied upon, no matter if those in the situation know or not about their observers.
6. A useful situation is temporary
7. A situation is useful to our aims when there is a third force that determines its end: for example a performance or a final presentation or a review

2.3 The Transformation

Transformation is the element that describes the welcomed rise of complexity in a creative process
1. In transformation self organisation is a good thing
2. Transformation is possible only in very strictly ruled systems with open situations
3. A reorganisation, gestalt re-orientation or simplification maneuver that breaks symmetry of the problem is a very good thing
4. Quality is not Perfection
5. Self similarity
6. Feedback
7. Storicize
8. Lie: a good story is worth a change of perspective
9. A transformator is the working implementation of a transformation into a situation that is at the same time representing itself. This is media art implemented.
10. Minimalism is baroque of the lazy people
