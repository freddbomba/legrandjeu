# sketch files
Sketch files have been compiled in bohemian code Sketch
It is proprietary software and mac only. They are temporary working files to share and create vectorial graphics
that I use in the still small cicle of people involved in working on LGJ.

It will be substitute with more, open standard file formats as soon as I find out what is appropriate and 
has the same functionalities
