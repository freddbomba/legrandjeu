> It is a honor to collaborate with the Eurofusion consortium to adapt 6 new scenarios of LGJ to play the future of energy in Europe, for the exibition “Fusion, Power to the People” curated by Mohamed Belhorma.

> EUROfusion supports and funds fusion research activities on behalf of the European Commission’s Euratom programme. Currently the future of energy is bound to critical choices, that involve to the core the political bodies of Europe to involve everyone into detailed critical decisions about energy. Sustainability, exploitation, delicate equilibrium of economical and strategical relevance, down to everyone’s own choices about everyday life. All turns round to the generation, availability and cost of energy

> Eurofusion is a consortium that currently ties 30 research organizations, and behind them 152 associated entities, including universities and companies, from 25 European Union member states plus the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Ukraine.

These new scenarios were played and refined in DTU Copenhagen in 2020 and can be played on your LGJ set now.
